# Bloc Jams

Bloc Jams was my first project as a web development student, teaching me the basic essentials for front-end development. Throughout the project, I flexed my learning skills with HTML, Javascript and refactoring with jQuery.

# The Framework

Prior to Bloc Jams, I had no experience with building an actual webpage, so the premesis of this project was to "learn by doing." Bloc helped me navigate the basics of front-end development through 23 diverse checkpoints, each setting me up with the code structure yet challenging me with various assignemnts.  With the help of my mentor, I configured code to make the site responsive and navigated through difficult javascript problems to ensure the pages would run smoother and faster. Although challenging, overall the project was extremely helpful in providing me with a strong foundation for front-end development. 

# I've got 99 problems...and they're all Javascript

The best and worst part of building Bloc Jams was making the site responsive. Quite a few of the checkpoints asked to configure code my own, which really put me out of my comfort zone. There were many times where I lacked confidence or felt I didn't know enough to figure out the code. However, after viewing the solutions I realized I had the right tools, and it was just a matter of using my knowledge to put everything together.

# There's a code for that

A lot of the battles I faced were on the Albums page because of the complexity of the moving parts. Before tackling it, I never would have thought that I needed to configure how to make an icon change from pause to play on a song number, while ensuring the icons on the player bar correlate, on top of making the current time and total length mesh with the time bar length. These challenges opened my eyes to the multiple facets it takes to build a responsive site. 

One of the notable issues I ran into was manipulating the play/pause button from player bar at the bottom of the page. To solve this, I used console.log to decipher at what point was the code not running correctly. This helped me diagnose my problem and figure out the appropriate solution.

# Putting it all together

Going into this project, I knew it would challenging yet fun. I thought it was extremely beneficial to dive into difficult DOM Scripting first, then learn how to refactor with jQuery. Since this was my first hands-on project, I was surprised to see how many parts we t into each page, especially when it came to simplifying long HTML code by refactoring it with Javascript. This project served as a great starting point for my future front-end endeavors.
