title: My Experience At Bloc
---

I'm exactly three months into Bloc's Full-Stack Web Development program, and its everything I thought it would be: fun, challenging, exciting and extremely frustrating. With no prior web development experience besides some Code Academy tutorials, I wasn’t 100% sure what I was getting myself into when I signed up for the program. I just knew that I wanted to learn how to become a web developer, and whether I make it a full-time career or not, it will be an extremely beneficial skill to have. 

Cue three months later…

Overall I’m happy with the program. Its a lot more difficult than I anticipated, but I’ve learned to accept that:

  1. Coding doesn’t come easy to me
  2. Coding will forever be an uphill battle 

And that’s ok. Originally I thought I could handle the 20-30 hour code weeks, on top of my 40-50 hour work week, on top of a personal life, but alas, I reached my breaking point. I realized that if I truly wanted to get my bang for buck, I should slow down my pace so I could study more and not rush through the materials just for the sake of completion. Bloc is super great about that. You’re able to switch your track pace whenever you want. If down the line I feel like I’m getting the hang of things, I can up my pace back to full-time when I please.  

As far as Bloc’s material goes, its definitely challenging. Although you have a mentor and a great community via Slack, there is no hand holding. The material pushes you to do your own research, read outside of the given materials and figure problems out on your own. There are times when I wish certain topics were covered more in depth or more preface was given about problems, but I think overall, Bloc and its staff are providing you with all of the right resources and knowledge to be successful in the program. However difficult it may be. 

I’m also impressed with the general web development knowledge Bloc provides you with. Over the past three months, I’ve learned to use a lot of tools and tricks that I don’t think a lot of noobs find out about until much later in their coding career. 

Case in point:  I went to my first coding MeetUp and there was a seasoned front-end developer who had no clue what Stack Overflow was…how does that even happen?? 

I also think Bloc does its best to prime you for a career. From getting involved in the coding community through MeetUps, researching career verticals or even setting up your LinkedIn connections and portfolio website, they want you to succeed. 

A lot of times as I’m chipping away at the material, I feel like I know nothing! However, after I look back on these past three months, I’m surprised at how much I’ve learned! Its exciting to keep progressing and overcoming challenges, and I look forward to seeing where the next three months will take me.
